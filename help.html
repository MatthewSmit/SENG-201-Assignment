The actions available are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Sleep - Put your pet to bed.
    <li>Toilet - Take your pet out to go toilet.
    <li>Feed - Feed your pet the selected food. Pets may prefer certain types of food.
    <li>Play - Play with your pet using the selected toy. Pets may prefer certain types of toys. Toys can break if pets are too rough with them.
</ul>

You are able to go to the next day or next player using the next button, and buy toys and food from the store.

Each day certain events can happen. Pets can get sick, or start misbehaving. Becoming sick requires medicine to get better, otherwise it will continue to get sick and may die. Pets are able to be revived from death once, but only once. Pets are more likely to get sick if it is overweight or too hungry, and pets may misbehave if they are unhappy or hungry.
