fix rotating pet icons in mgp (maingamepanel)

set health to 0 when pet dies

get medicine+revival medicine working

game keeps going after max number of days! (tested with 2 players/5 days/3 pets per player). 
Doesn't finish - after day X of X should give a small window telling user(s) that game has finished and exit out of program.

potentially add scroll bar to pet info stuff in mgp, so that the interface can be changed so it isn't so stretched

rearrange ordering of stuff in pet info (+ make look nicer - e.g. first capital letter)

write up report

UML diagram

extra tests?
